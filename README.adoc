Custom validators can override functions:

`String getTestName()`::
The name of the test.
Names of different tests must be unique and must start with a `/`.

`Result validate(Iterable<RpmPackage> rpms, List<String> args)`::
Validate the RPM files and produce a <<_result>> describing what was checked.
The validator is supposed fill its result with log entries as it is being executed.
The list of arguments `args` is passed whether from command line or from a configuration file.
This function should wrap any thrown exceptions in the returned result as the `error` log entry.
For details, see the section <<_result_states>>.

[#_result]
=== Result

`TestResult getResult()`::
The state of this result as described in <<_result_states>>.

`Iterator<LogEntry> iterator()`::
